# Domain zone information aggregator

If you've ever bought a domain, you know what it's like: you have to open a dozen registrar websites, manually enter domain names, figure out the terms and conditions, wait for the pages to load, skip the adsâ€¦ And then you find out that renewal is three times more expensive and private WHOIS is a paid option.

[tld-list](https://tld-list.com) solves all these issues on one page.

It is an aggregator of all information on domain zones:

- shows the price of registration and renewal with popular registrars (including hidden fees)
- displays which zones support WHOIS privacy
- allows you to filter domains by length, characters, and availability
- sorts by price and features (for example, you can exclude zones with premium prices)

No outdated collections, manually searching through registrars, or questions like *"how much does .dev cost at Namecheap?"*. **tld-list** does it for you.
