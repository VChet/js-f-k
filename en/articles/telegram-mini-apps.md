# Telegram Mini Apps: Quick Start

Creating mini apps for **Telegram** is easier than it seems.

All you need to do is:

1. Register a bot via [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather);
1. Provide a link to your website.

After that, the website will open directly within Telegram — without any complex logic or integrations. In fact, it's the same website, only launched in the messenger.

Want to make it perfect? Optimize the page for the Telegram window size, create a separate quick landing page, or add support for specific APIs. A detailed analysis with examples of such improvements can be found in the article on Habr: [Telegram Mini App. How to create a Web App from scratch (RU)](https://habr.com/ru/companies/amvera/articles/838180/).

The main thing is to start simple, and you can master the details later.
