# An alternative to Postman and Insomnia

**Postman** has long been more than just a simple REST client: it has grown to include authorization, clouds, and paid features. **Insomnia** used to be a lightweight alternative, but it has gradually become more complex and restricted free access. Now it is no longer the right tool for basic tasks.

[Yaak](https://yaak.app) is a new attempt to return to simplicity. It works locally, does not require registration, and offers only basic functionality. If you need a simple and straightforward REST client without distracting add-ons, **Yaak** may be a good fit. For more context, see [the author's post](https://yaak.app/blog/yet-another-api-client).
